# Getting Started with Train Travel API

## Introduction

API for finding and booking train trips across Europe.

### Run in Postman

Experiment with this API in Postman, using our Postman Collection.

## Building

### Requirements

The SDK relies on **Node.js** and **npm** (to resolve dependencies). It also requires **Typescript version 3.9+**. You can download and install Node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> **NOTE:** npm is installed by default when Node.js is installed.

### Verify Successful Installation

Run the following commands in the command prompt or shell of your choice to check if Node.js and npm are successfully installed:

* Node.js: `node --version`

* npm: `npm --version`

### Install Dependencies

- To resolve all dependencies, go to the **SDK root directory** and run the following command with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- This will install all dependencies in the **node_modules** folder.

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the generated library in a new project.

### 1. Initialize the Node Project

- Open an IDE/text editor for JavaScript like Visual Studio Code. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

- Click on **File** and select **Open Folder**. Select an empty folder of your project, the folder will become visible in the sidebar on the left.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?step=openProject)

- To initialize the Node project, click on **Terminal** and select **New Terminal**. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init --y
```

### 2. Add Dependencies to the Client Library

- The created project manages its dependencies using its `package.json` file. In order to add a dependency on the *Train Travel APILib* client library, double click on the `package.json` file in the bar on the left and add the dependency to the package in it.

- To install the package in the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Test the SDK

To validate the functionality of this SDK, you can execute all tests located in the `test` directory. This SDK utilizes `Jest` as both the testing framework and test runner.

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the SDK and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or you can also run tests with coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | `string` | The fully-qualified hostname of the API<br>*Default*: `'api.example.com'` |
| `environment` | `Environment` | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.Production`** |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout for API calls.<br>*Default*: `0` |
| `httpClientOptions` | `Partial<HttpClientOptions>` | Stable configurable http client options. |
| `unstableHttpClientOptions` | `any` | Unstable configurable http client options. |
| `authorizationCodeAuthCredentials` | [`AuthorizationCodeAuthCredentials`](doc/auth/oauth-2-authorization-code-grant.md) | The credential object for authorizationCodeAuth |

### HttpClientOptions

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds. |
| `httpAgent` | `any` | Custom http agent to be used when performing http requests. |
| `httpsAgent` | `any` | Custom https agent to be used when performing http requests. |
| `retryConfig` | `Partial<RetryConfiguration>` | Configurations to retry requests. |

### RetryConfiguration

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `maxNumberOfRetries` | `number` | Maximum number of retries. <br> *Default*: `0` |
| `retryOnTimeout` | `boolean` | Whether to retry on request timeout. <br> *Default*: `true` |
| `retryInterval` | `number` | Interval before next retry. Used in calculation of wait time for next request in case of failure. <br> *Default*: `1` |
| `maximumRetryWaitTime` | `number` | Overall wait time for the requests getting retried. <br> *Default*: `0` |
| `backoffFactor` | `number` | Used in calculation of wait time for next request in case of failure. <br> *Default*: `2` |
| `httpStatusCodesToRetry` | `number[]` | Http status codes to retry against. <br> *Default*: `[408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]` |
| `httpMethodsToRetry` | `HttpMethod[]` | Http methods to retry against. <br> *Default*: `['GET', 'PUT']` |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```ts
const client = new Client({
  authorizationCodeAuthCredentials: {
    oAuthClientId: 'OAuthClientId',
    oAuthClientSecret: 'OAuthClientSecret',
    oAuthRedirectUri: 'OAuthRedirectUri',
    oAuthScopes: [
      OAuthScopeEnum.Read,
      OAuthScopeEnum.Write
    ]
  },
  timeout: 0,
  environment: Environment.Production,
  host: 'api.example.com',
});
```
